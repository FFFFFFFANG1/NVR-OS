# NVR-OS
A Unix-like operating system make from scratch. This system is a half-semester project from ECE391 at UIUC.

The machine needs to run on QEMU or other x86 stimulators. For an online demo and more information, please refer to https://os391junzhouf.com/ (The website will be maintained until 2026)

Please note: I'm currently a CA of ECE391, and some of our codes were written in a dumb way, i.e. not optimized.  Therefore, I will know if you copy any code from this respository.

Introduction from the website:

This operating system is the 3rd MP of ECE 391 Fall 2023, Computer Systems Engineering,
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
It was developed by a group of four people (last name in alphabetic order):
Junzhou Fang;
Junsheng Huang;
Lishan Shi;a
Zixin Zhu;

The website is made and maintained by Junzhou Fang.
The name of this operating system is taken from the average of each member's name of the group in alphabetic order. We input JZF, JSH, LSS, ZXZ and get the average three letters, NVR.
I want to appreciate Professors, TAs, and CAs from Fall 2023 again for their help during the development.
Also, I want to appreciate Pai Zhang for his great help on making this website. I just used his open-source code and made some modifictaion
